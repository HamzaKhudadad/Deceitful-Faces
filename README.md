# Deceitful-Faces
This is a dialogue-based computer game that utilizes the Player’s emotional state to affect the game’s flow of events and atmosphere.
This Game features multiple scenarios we face each day in our life like:
* Police Interrogation,
* Couple with Struggling Marriage 
* presenting a project to boss 
* Our Psychiatrist sessions
* Interviews 
etc.

Most of games in this genre offer a variety of different features and quality gameplay but we have some problems that are not tackled like Same Static Stories; 
No matter how evolving the story is but it has a liner ending and never progresses with players responses No Expression Analysis; 
We don’t have a game in this genre yet that takes your input and Analyzes your expressions also to progress in the game and trigger events accordingly

### Our Approch 
Our system is an approach towards more realistic Gaming by leveraging the latest developments in computer vision and machine learning. 
Using FER (Facial Expression Recognition)and Speech Emotions,FER helps us to  analyze player reactions to various in game scenarios and then we adjust the AI according to the
Expressions and Emotions of Player.
